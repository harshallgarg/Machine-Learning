# Machine-Learning
Stores the basic models that I've worked on:

1. <a href='https://github.com/harshallgarg/Machine-Learning-On-Google-Colab/blob/master/carPricePredictionEdited.ipynb'>Car Price Prediction Model</a> is a multilinear regression model with an R-squared value of 0.912, explaining 90% of the variance. Contains the minimum variables having maximum significance in the model. This forked Kaggle Notebook has helped me clear many doubts and has taught a lot about data preprocessing and data visualisation :  <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/harshallgarg/carprice-prediction-mlr-rfe-vif'>Car Price Prediction Model using MLR-RFE-VIF</a>
